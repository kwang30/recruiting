# Support Engineer Challenge

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to see how you might approach handling a support
request with some basic debugging. It the asks you to apply a bit of best
practices by fixing the problem and providing some simple tests to ensure the
bug doesn't happen again.

## Prompt

One of our member's is having trouble signing in to the website. There are no
reported system's issues, and the `/log-in` endpoint appears to be responding
normally. The team member who received this support request already made sure
that they can log themself in.

The member's name is Radric Davis and his password is `test1234`.

Please do the following:

1. Assess what problem Radric might be having as he signs in.
2. If you find a bug, fix the work of some sloppy engineer.
3. To ensure said sloppy engineer never ruins your day again, write a test that
   keeps them in line.
4. Write a summary of your investigation and process at the end of this README.

## Dependencies

- Ensure you have a working Node.js environment of at least version 8.0.
- Getting the project started follows a typical Node.js application pattern.
- A convenience script `npm run develop` has been added to make debugging and
  testing code a little easier.
- `npm test` runs your tests.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following:

1.  Did you find and fix any bugs, if they exist?
2.  Did you write proper tests?
3.  Is your summary clear, smart and thorough?

## Time Limit

Please take as much time as you need for this project, but provide a best guess
of how long it took you when you send me your results.

## Wrap up

- Please place your finished source code on GitHub or provide the project as a
  zip file I can easily download.
- Email me the repository URL at michael@parsleyhealth.com
- We will then schedule a short wrap up call to go over your results and the
  thought and planning you applied to this project.
