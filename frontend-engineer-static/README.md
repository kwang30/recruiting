# Frontend Engineer Challenge

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to see how you might approach a frontend
engineering project that involves a certain amount of creative interpretation,
and technical knowhow. This project loosely simulates working with a marketing
team to build out a new page or site section.

## Prompt: Marketing Website

The marketing team would like to make a simple standalone page template for
their various events. They haven't been able to engage design yet, but they
would like to put together a simple functional mockup using Parsley Health's
existing visual language and styles.

## Project Requirements

### General

* Lives on a single page
* The whole page should be responsive
  * Looks great on desktop (1200px width screen)
  * Looks great on mobile (375px width screen)
* The page should look reasonably on-brand as a mockup, though design will be
  revisiting this before it is released, so don't sweat it too much.
* Wherever text is required, use lorem ipsum or other dummy text
* Wherever links are required use dummy links unless otherwise requested

### Regions

* Header / Footer

  * Use an abbreviated header and footer similar to those here:
    https://join.parsleyhealth.com/

* Hero

  * Full width image (pick from assets)
  * Event title overlaid
  * Event description overlaid
  * CTA to trigger a modal overlay for signup (see below)

* Block #1 - Location

  * Provide location information about the event (our offices at 33 Irving Pl)
  * Include a small map that links to Google Maps for the location

* Block #2 - Related Content

  * Create a grid of six thumbnails linking to various related blog posts
  * Include the titles of the blog posts
  * Just use dummy text and links. No need to find real stores.

* Modal Overlay

  * Create a modal overlay that has brief descriptive text and form fields for
    first name, last name, email, and a submit button.
  * You should be able to close the overlay

### Assets

* **Images** There are a number photos in the assets folder for you to use.
  Please use them freely for this project, and take inspiration from them if
  needed. Don't worry though, you are not going to be judged as a photo editor.

* **Fonts** Our custom fonts are not available for use, but these two from
  Google Fonts come close:

  * https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla
  * https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville

### Relevant Links

The following links should be helpful for getting the look and feel of some of
the features that already exist on the site.

* https://join.parsleyhealth.com/
* https://www.parsleyhealth.com/healthcare/
* https://www.parsleyhealth.com/company/
* https://www.parsleyhealth.com/library/
* https://www.parsleyhealth.com/blog/hormonal-birth-control-side-effects/

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following:

1.  Does it work?
2.  Use of proper tools:
    * Styles processing: SASS, LESS, PostCSS
    * Modern approach to styles: flexbox, BEM or similar code convention
    * Clean JS using whatever approach you find easiest
    * Some sort of task runner / dev server I can run to view the website (Gulp,
      Webpack, or even Jekyll might be fine)
3.  Does it look presentable as a mockup?
4.  Cleanliness and clarity of code.

## Time Limit

Please take as much time as you need for this project, but provide a best guess
of how long it took you when you send me your results.

## Wrap up

* Please place your finished source code on GitHub or provide the project as a
  zip file I can easily download.
* Email me the repository URL at michael@parsleyhealth.com
* We will then schedule a short wrap up call to go over your results and the
  thought and planning you applied to this project.
