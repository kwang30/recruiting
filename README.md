Patient Ingest Form Application
===============================

### Overview

In this task you'll be creating and deploying a full, simple, client-side application. Every aspect to the task is a part of the test, and the goal is to see how well you realize the sort of project you might be expected to work on here at Parsley Health.

### Requirements

I would like you to create a **multi-step** patient ingest form that gathers the following data. Please use your best judgement on what sorts of questions to ask.  

* Demographic data: name, email, address, birthdate, etc.
* Medical history: check boxes, freeform fields.
* Acceptance of a contract (lorem ipsum text is fine).
* Several “screens” should be used to organize the information, with no full page reload between them.

Then, finishing up:  

* Present a wrap-up or summary screen prior to submission where you print the collected data, and which allows the patient to go back and edit a detail if it was entered incorrectly.
* Submit the collected data to a mock REST API as JSON data (please just send a request for me to inspect, even if it fails, or console.log the payload in the client, but don’t set up a DB, persistence is not needed).
* Reset the form.

### Evaluation

Generally, I’ll be evaluating your work along the following lines:

* Cleanliness and clarity of code!
* Project organization
* Management of data internally, and state handling
* Consideration of pertinent questions and collected data
* General polish of execution
* Consideration of UX — not that you have to go deep on design, any style framework is fine
* Tools used to complete the task: JS frameworks, build tools, etc

### Delivery

[Email](michael@parsleyhealth.com) me the following:

* Source code should be placed on GitHub for review
* The url to the web accessible application

### Hints

* Focus on what I’m evaluating you on. While showing me what you can do with a web service framework might be impressive, the bulk of this task is about front-end user experience and process, so get that done first.
* Be efficient! Please don’t reinvent the wheel, use generators and other tools when they speed up your process and get you to your end goal faster.
* GitHub Pages is free and easy.
